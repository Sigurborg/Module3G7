For this assignment I reallhy wanted to try some new things. 
I did Event Listeners button witch was fun. I did a Button witch changes colors.

Then I started trying out making a tic tac toe game. That became very complicated and a huges challange for me. Javascript is not my strong game but I am learning... And after a lot of work the game finally worked as i hoped.
